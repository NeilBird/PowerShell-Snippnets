# Legacy-Azure-Snippets

This folder in the PowerShell-Snippnets GitHub repository is used to share old PowerShell scripts that I created to help customers with Azure automation and administration examples.

** These "old scripts" should be reviewed and updated (as needed) prior to use. They are very old and modules will have changed significantly since they were last used.

There is no warranty or official support for any of the scripts / code in this repository, but if you encounter problem, please raise an issue using GitHub.
