# PowerShell-Snippnets

This PowerShell-Snippnets GitHub repository was initially setup to share some old PowerShell scripts that I created to help customers with Azure automation and administration example.

** These "old scripts" should be reviewed and updated (as needed) prior to use. They are very old and modules will have changed significantly since they were last used.

This repository is also being used to share PowerShell module and functions that I author to help with Azure Local deployment and automation.

There is no warranty or official support for any of the scripts / code in this repository, but if you encounter problem, please raise an issue using GitHub.
