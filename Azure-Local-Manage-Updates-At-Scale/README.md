## Parameters

The workbook provides several filtering options to help you focus on specific resources:

### Scope Filters
- **Subscriptions**: Filter data by one or more Azure subscriptions (defaults to all accessible subscriptions)

### Resource Group Filter
- **Resource Group Filter**: Optional wildcard filter for resource group names
  - Use `*` as a wildcard character to match any sequence of characters
  - Examples:
    - `*-prod-*` matches resource groups containing "-prod-" (e.g., "rg-hci-prod-01", "azure-prod-cluster")
    - `*hci*` matches any resource group containing "hci"
    - `rg-*` matches resource groups starting with "rg-"
  - Leave empty to show all resource groups

### Cluster Tag Filter
- **Cluster Tag Name**: The name of the tag to filter by (e.g., "Environment", "Team", "CostCenter")
- **Cluster Tag Value**: The value of the tag to match (e.g., "Production", "IT-Ops")
- **Note**: Tag filtering applies **only to Azure Local clusters** - it does not filter AKS Arc clusters or Azure Local VMs
- Both Tag Name and Tag Value must be provided for the filter to take effect

### Time Range
- **Time Range**: Select the time range for time-based queries (1 day to 30 days, or custom)

## Usage Tips

- Use the subscription filter to focus on specific environments (e.g., production vs. development)
- Regularly check the Update Readiness tab before scheduling maintenance windows
- Monitor the ARB Status tab to ensure Azure Arc connectivity is healthy
- Export data to Excel using the export button on grids for reporting purposes
- Set up Azure Monitor alerts based on the queries in this workbook for proactive monitoring
